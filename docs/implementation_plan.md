# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for the Odoo Dev Server Monitoring Tool.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] **1. Write Tests**
  - Set up testing framework (pytest)
  - Implement test cases for each functionality as outlined in testing.md
  - Create mock services and fixtures for testing

- [x] **2. Implement Core Backend**
  - Set up FastAPI application structure
  - Implement service monitoring functionality
  - Implement system resource monitoring
  - Implement module directory management
  - Implement permission fixing logic

- [x] **3. Develop API Layer**
  - Create RESTful endpoints for all functionality
  - Implement websocket connections for real-time updates
  - Add error handling and validation

- [x] **4. Build Frontend**
  - Create responsive dashboard layout
  - Implement service control UI components
  - Implement module directory management UI
  - Add real-time updates via websockets
  - Ensure mobile-friendly design

- [x] **5. Finalize & Package**
  - Create installation script
  - Write documentation
  - Perform final testing
  - Package for distribution
  - Create systemd service installation

## Development Approach

The implementation will follow a test-driven development approach, with tests written before functionality. Each component will be developed incrementally, ensuring it passes all tests before moving to the next component.

The backend and frontend will be developed in parallel where possible, with the API serving as the contract between them.
